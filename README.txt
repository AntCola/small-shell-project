HOW TO COMPILE WITH MAKEFILE:
-use command 'make'
-after using make in the terminal the executable 'smallsh' will be created to run
-to clean up the executables created type 'make clean'

IF ISSUES WITH MAKEFILE:
-in the terminal use 'gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c' to compile the smallsh executable which
will be available for use with the testing script

TO RUN TESTING SCRIPT:
-to run the testing script I used the following commands:
'chmod +x ./p2testscript'
'p2testscript 2 > & 1'
-after these commands are inputed into the console the file in the directory named '1' held
the testing script results for me
